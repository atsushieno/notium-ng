# notium-ng: Notium, next-gen

## What is this?

This is an ongoing port of my [notium](https://github.com/atsushieno/notium/) programmable MIDI operation generator based on [mugene](https://github.com/atsushieno/mugene) [Music Macro Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language) instruction sets, so that I can go forward and improve the entire ecosystem and toolchains.

While it is named as next-gen, there is nothing improved from former C# project so far.  But at this state, future development will happen here, not in C# repo.

Everything, including the project name, is subject to change at this moment, so if you want to use it you might want to use some revisions off of the `main` branch.

The entire language is not documented at all, but feature wise the API is based on mugene MML compiler.
